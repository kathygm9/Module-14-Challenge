# Belly Button Biodiversity Dashboard

## Overview

Welcome to the Belly Button Biodiversity Dashboard! This interactive tool allows you to explore fascinating insights from the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset, which catalogs the diverse microbes inhabiting human navels. Dive into the microbial world and uncover intriguing patterns within this unique ecosystem.

## Features

- **Bar Chart**: Visualize the top 10 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) found in each individual's navel. Explore the abundance of microbial species using sample values, with OTU IDs serving as labels and OTU labels providing additional information on hover.

- **Bubble Chart**: Delve deeper into the microbial diversity with a bubble chart displaying each sample. Discover the distribution of OTUs using OTU IDs for the x-axis, sample values for the y-axis, and marker size. Marker colors represent OTU IDs, while OTU labels provide context for each data point.

- **Sample Metadata Display**: Gain insights into individual demographics with metadata display. Explore key demographic information for each sample, dynamically updating as you select different samples.

- **Dynamic Updates**: Seamlessly update all visualizations and metadata display when selecting a new sample. Effortlessly navigate through the dataset and observe real-time changes in microbial composition.

- **Customizable Layout**: Tailor your dashboard layout to suit your preferences. Create a personalized exploration experience by arranging visualizations and metadata display according to your needs.

- **Deployment**: Easily deploy your dashboard using GitHub Pages or any other free static page hosting service. Share your findings with others by providing the deployment link and GitHub repository.
